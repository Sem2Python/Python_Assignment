# Calculate employee income tax based on the following formula: 
# Tax = 0.25 * (monthly income * 11 â€“ number of kids * 450) 
# Your program will display the name of the employee and amount of tax on the screen. 
# name = input("Enter employee name: ")
# monthly_income = float(input(f"Enter monthly income of {name}: "))
# no_kids = int(input("Enter number of kids: "))
# Tax = 0.25 * ( (monthly_income* 11 )- (no_kids * 450)) 
# print("Employee Name: ",name)
# print("Tax amount: ",Tax)

# 3. Receive an integer from the user, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the 
# final number on the screen. 
# print("Solve: 2*(x+5)-7\n")
# num = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
# solve = 2*(num+5)-7
# print("Reqiured solution is: ",solve)

# 4. Calculate area and circumference of circle. 
# radius = float(input("Enter radius of a circle: "))
# pi = 3.14
# area = pi*radius*radius
# circumference = 2*pi*radius*radius
# print("Area of a circle: ",area)
# print("Circumference of a circle: ", circumference)

# 5. Calculate and print the average of three numbers: 20, 10, and 2.
# num1,num2,num3 = (int (i) for i in input("Enter three numbers: ").split())
# avg = (num1+num2+num3)/3
# print("Average of three numbers: ",avg)
